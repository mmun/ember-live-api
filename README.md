## Ember Live API

This project aims to replicate the functionality of the emberjs.com/api/ site (which is statically generated), with an Ember application that uses the 
YUIDoc output directly. This will allow us to access documentation for nearly any version of Ember (instead of a single version).

### TODO

This is a listing of the things I think that need to be done before we can really push to change out the current static generated API docs with this:

* Add routes allowing direct linking to specific 'classitems' (methods, properties, events).
* Allow passing the data via URL (either by query string or dynamic segment).
* Make ApiOptions actually filter (Inherited, Protected, Private, and Deprecated).
* Figure out rendering speed issues (takes 1/2 second to switch from index view to method view, why?).

### Contributing
